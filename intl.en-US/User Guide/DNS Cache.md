DNS Cache 
==============================





Benefits 
-----------------------------

* Distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack mitigation: DNS Cache caches DNS responses to protect your authoritative DNS servers from DDoS attacks and reduce the load on your authoritative DNS servers.

  

* DNS access acceleration: Alibaba Cloud DNS provides global nodes. DNS Cache allows you to access the nearest node and accelerates the access speed.

  

* Backup for DNS servers: When an error occurs in authoritative domain names, DNS Cache allows you to use the service before the cached DNS records expire. This shorter the time wasted by failures.

  

* Cost-effectiveness: If you use an on-premises DNS, DNS Cache can help you reduce bandwidth usage to save costs.
